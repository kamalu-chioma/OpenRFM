## OpenRFM - RFM Customer Analyzer

## Welcome to RFM Customer Analyzer

OpenRFM is an open-source tool that helps businesses analyze customer behavior through **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)** analysis. Understand your customers' buying behavior to improve marketing strategies, retention, and revenue generation.

## Why Segment Customers?

Not all customers are the same. By clustering customers based on their behavior, businesses can:
- **Tailor marketing**: Create personalized campaigns based on customer behavior.
- **Improve retention**: Identify high-value and at-risk customers.
- **Maximize revenue**: Optimize targeting to drive sales and reduce churn.

## What RFM Reveals:
- **High-value customers**: Identify those who generate the most revenue.
- **Churn prediction**: Detect customers likely to stop engaging.
- **Marketing optimization**: Tailor campaigns to target different customer segments effectively.

## How It Works (RFM):
- **Recency (R)**: Days since the customer's last purchase.
- **Frequency (F)**: How often the customer makes a purchase.
- **Monetary (M)**: Total amount the customer spends.

## Who Is This For?
- **Businesses tracking customer engagement**: Improve customer relationships and sales.
- **Marketers predicting churn & loyalty**: Retain high-value customers.
- **Data scientists analyzing customer behavior**: Dive deeper into customer segmentation and trends.
