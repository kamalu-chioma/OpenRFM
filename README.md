## About the Project

RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to segment customers based on three factors:
1. **Recency** – How recently a customer made a purchase.
2. **Frequency** – How often they make purchases.
3. **Monetary Value** – How much money they spend.

This project aims to create an RFM analysis tool that is easy to integrate for small and medium businesses (SMBs) with a variety of data sources and is highly customizable.

## Getting Started

To get started with OpenRFM, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib (for basic RFM analysis and visualization)
- Jupyter (for running and testing)

You can install the dependencies using the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Data Requirements for RFM Analysis

To perform RFM analysis for multiple stores, the data format should be consistent. Here's an outline of the required columns for your dataset:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **OrderDate**: The date when the order was placed.
- **OrderID**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **TotalSpent**: The total value of the order.

Ensure that your data is cleaned and follows this structure to avoid issues when running the RFM analysis.
